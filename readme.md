## üéØ What is python ? ‚úÖ

-> Python is a high-level programming language that is widely used for \
various purpose such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.

It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.\
It features a clear and concise syntax, which allows developers to write code quickly and efficiently. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, \
including porcedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

## üéØ What is Byte-Code in python ? ‚úÖ

-> In python, bytecode refers to the intermediate representation of the source code that is generated by the Python interpreter. When you write a Python script or enter commands in the Python shell, the Python interpreter first tanslates the source code into bytecode before executing it.

Bytecode is a low-level, platform-independent representation of the souce code that is optimized for efficient execution by the Python virtual machine(PVM). It is not directly executable by the computer's hardware like machine code, but it serves as an intermidiary step between the source code and the execution.

The bytecode is stored in `.pyc` files (compiled Python files) or in memory if the code is entered interactively. These `.pyc` files are created by the interpreter to speed up the execution of Python programs by avoiding the need to recompile the source code every time it is executed.

When you run a Python script, the interpreter checks if a corresponding `.pyc` file exists and if it is up-to-date with the source code. If the `.pyc` file exists and is up-to-date, the interpreter loads and executes the bytecode directly, speeding up the execution process. If the `.pyc` file is missing or outdated, the interpreter recompiles the source code into bytecode and then executes it.

Overall, bytecode plays a crucial role in the execution of Python programs, providing a platform-independent and efficient representation of the source code for interpretation by the Python virtual machine.

## üéØ What is virtual machine in python ? ‚úÖ

-> In Python, the term "virtual machine" refers to the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). The PVM is an interpreter that executes Python bytecode. It is responsible for translating the bytecode generated from Python source code into machine code that can be understood and executed by the underlying hardware.

The PVM abstracts the underlying hardware architecture, providing a platform-independent runtime environment for Python programs. This means that Python code can be written and executed on any platform (such as Windows, macOS, or Linux) without modification, as long as the appropriate Python interpreter is available for that platform.

The PVM manages memory allocation, garbage collection, and other runtime tasks required for executing Python code. It also provides access to the Python standard library and any additional modules or packages that are installed.

Overall, the Python Virtual Machine plays a crucial role in the execution of Python programs, providing a consistent and portable runtime environment across different platforms.

## üéØ What is frozen binaries in python ? ‚úÖ

-> In Python, frozen binaries typically refer to executable files that contain both the Python interpreter and the bytecode of a Python script, packaged together into a single standalone file. These frozen binaries are generated using tools like PyInstaller or cx_Freeze.

When you freeze a Python script into a binary, the resulting executable includes the Python interpreter along with any necessary libraries and dependencies, allowing the program to be run on a system that doesn't have Python installed. This makes distribution and deployment of Python applications more convenient, as users don't need to install Python separately to run the application.

Frozen binaries are often used for distributing Python applications as standalone executables, especially for deployment on systems where installing Python may not be feasible or desirable. They encapsulate the entire Python environment needed to run the application, making it easier to distribute and execute Python code across different platforms.

## üéØ Do you know what `__pychache__` means ? ‚úÖ

-> `__pycache__` is a directory automatically generated by Python to store compiled bytecode files (`.pyc` files) when a Python module is imported. This directory is created in the same directory as the Python script or module being executed.

The purpose of the `__pycache__` directory is to improve the performance of Python programs by caching compiled bytecode. When a Python module is imported, the interpreter checks if a corresponding `.pyc` file exists in the `__pycache__` directory. If the `.pyc` file exists and is up-to-date with the source code, the interpreter loads the bytecode from the `.pyc` file instead of recompiling the source code, which can save time and resources.

The `__pycache__` directory is automatically managed by Python and typically doesn't need manual intervention. It's safe to ignore or delete the `__pycache__` directory if necessary, as Python will recreate it as needed when modules are imported.

# üéØ Immutable and mutable in python ‚úÖ

-> In python, data types can be classified as either mutable or immutable, depending on whether their values can be changed after they are created.

1. <b>Immutable Data Types:</b> Immutable data types are those whose values cannot be changed after they are created. Any operation that appears to modify an immutable object actually creates a new object with the modified value. Examples of immutable data types in Python include:\
   üå≤int (integer)\
   üå≤float (floating-point number)\
   üå≤str (string)\
   üå≤tuple\
   üå≤frozenset

‚≠ê Example:

    username = "sagar"

‚≠ê Example:

    x = 10
    y = x
    print(x) # gives output as 10
    print(y) # gives output as 10
    x = 15
    print(x) # gives output as 15
    print(y) # gives output as 10

![diagram_explaination](./assets/img/Screenshot%202024-03-24%20231752.png)

üìí In the above two examples, you can understand the concept of immutable and mutable in python only by the diagram. Whenever we create a variable and assign a immutable type value to it, It's value is stored in the memory and the variable name(username) is then takes refrence of that memory location.

So, whenever we assign a new value to the immutable data type, a new memory location is assigned and it's reference is given to the variable. It previous value of that variable is removed by the garbage collector of python and then removed from the memory if not in use or referenced by any other variable.
